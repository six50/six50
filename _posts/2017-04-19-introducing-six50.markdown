It's April 19th, and yesterday Theresa May announced plans for the UK to hold a general election on June 8th. This morning Parliament voted to go ahead with [97% voting in favour](hansard-results), more than the two thirds majority required by the [Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011](fixed-term-act)

We are a group of data scientists and software engineers who want to bring transparency to the data surrounding this next election.

It's early days, and we don't yet have a concrete direction, but stay tuned and watch out for updates over the next 50 days.
